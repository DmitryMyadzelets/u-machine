# Finite state machine micro helper for Node.js

If you need a state-machine-like behavior, and feel that great frameworks like [the one of Jake Gordon](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine), [_machina_ of Jim Cowart](https://github.com/ifandelse/machina.js) or [_Stately.js_
 of Florian Sch√§fer](https://github.com/fschaefer/Stately.js) is too much for you, then this helper may be just what you are looking for.

Based on the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it) principles, the core of this module is just [a couple of functions](https://github.com/DmitryMyadzelets/u-machine/blob/master/index.js).

## Use cases

- [OAuth client for authorization with Facebook](https://github.com/DmitryMyadzelets/u-machine/tree/master/examples/oauth-client), Google, Yandex and Vkontakte.

# How to use
```bash
    npm install u-machine
```

```javascript
const machine = require('u-machine')
```
Pass any object to the `machine`. It returns a *runner* function which will be the only entry point for events. The object is required to have just one property `states` with states defined as functions:

```javascript
const run = machine({
    states: {
        initial: function () {},
        // ...
        any_name: function () {}
    }
}
```

The machine creates other properties:

    current - A current state function
    prior   - The last state function the machine made a transition from
    machine - Reference to the runner function 

## Running

Run the machine passing events to it. Events may be just any stuff you want. The machine passes all parameters you throw to it to a function corresponding to the current state.

```javascript
const run = machine({...})
run() // event is undefined
run({}, [], function () {})
```

## Initial state

The definition of initial state for the state machine is required. There are two ways to define the initial state. One way is to name any state as `initial`:

```javascript
machine({
    states: {
        initial: function () {
            // some code
        }
    }
})
```

Other way is to create `initial` function which returns the initial state:

```javascript
machine({
    initial: function () {
        return this.states.stop
    },
    states: {
        stop: function () {
            // some code
        }
    }
})
```

If the both ways are mixed then the `initial` state will be used:

```javascript
const run = machine({
    initial: function () {
        console.log('This function will not be called')
    },
    states: {
        initial: function () {
            console.log('The initial state')
        }
    }
})

run() // The initial state
```

## Current state

You may wonder how to get the current state the machine at. Since the states are the functions you may use named state function and then use `.current.name` property (make sure it's [supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name)). Alternatively, if you use anonymous functions, you can pass states to `machine.deanonymize` method. It creates `named` properties equal the states functions names.

```javascript
const o = {
    states: {
        initial: function () {},
        final: function () {}
    }
}

machine.deanonymize(o.states) // [ 'initial', 'final' ]
machine(o)

o.current.named // 'initial'
```

## Transitions

To make a transition to another state the state function should return a state the machine jumps to. If no state is returned then the machine remains at the same state.

```javascript
const run = machine({
    initial: function () {
        return this.states.stop
    },
    states: {
        stop: function () {
            // some code
            return this.states.run
        },
        run: function () {
            // will stay here forever
        }
    }
})

// The current state is 'stop'
run() // Makes transition from 'stop' to 'run'
run() // Makes transition from 'run' to 'run'
```

In state functions the keyword `this` always refers to the object you created the machine with:

```javascript
const obj = {
    states: {
        initial: function (text) {
            console.log(this === obj, text)
        }
    }
}

const run = machine(obj)

run('A') // true 'A'
run.call({}, 'B') // true 'B'
```

Your machine may have many event sources. If you need to observe all of them, create a `transition` function in your object. The events you pass to the machine will also be passed to this function _after_ they are processed in the current state:

```javascript
const run = machine({
    states: {
        initial: function (o) {
            o.n += 1
        }
    },
    transition: function (o) {
        console.log(o.n)
    }
})

run({n: 1}) // 2
```

## Logging (debugging) transitions

Inside the transition function the keyword `this` refers to the object with states description. The machine jumps from the `this.prior` state to the `this.current` state. However, if states are anonymous functions, it is hard to understand which actually the prior and current states are.

Here is a solution you may use:

```javascript
const obj = {
    states: {
        initial: function () {
            return this.states.run
        },
        run: function () {}
    },
    transition: function () {
        console.log('transition from', this.prior.named,
                'to', this.current.named)
    }
}
const run = machine(obj)

machine.deanonymize(obj.states)

run() // transition from initial to run
run() // transition from run to run
```

The `deanonymize` method creates properties for functions with the same values as the object's keys. You can change default property name `named` to another passing it as a second argument:

```javascript
machine.deanonymize(obj.states, 'stateName')
```

## External and internal events

Let's say we want the machine to count up to 10. Below is the example where we both control the counter and fire events externally:

```javascript
const obj = {
    counter: 0,
    states: {
        initial: function () {
            return this.states.run
        },
        run: function () {
            this.counter += 1
        }
    },
    transition: function () {
        console.log(this.counter)
    }
}

const run = machine(obj)

while (obj.counter < 10) {
    run()
}
// 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

It may be more convenient to let the machine control the logic, and fire events to itself internally. The events entry function is accessible by the `machine` property:

```javascript
const run = machine({
    counter: 0,
    states: {
        initial: function () {
            setImmediate(this.machine)
            return this.states.run
        },
        run: function () {
            this.counter += 1
            if (this.counter < 10) {
                setImmediate(this.machine)
            }
        }
    },
    transition: function () {
        console.log(this.counter)
    }
})

run() // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```
Another way, where we fire events at a single point:

```javascript
const run = machine({
    counter: 0,
    states: {
        initial: function () {
            return this.states.run
        },
        run: function () {
            this.counter += 1
        }
    },
    transition: function () {
        console.log(this.counter)
        if (this.counter < 10) {
            setImmediate(this.machine)
        }
    }
})

run() // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

## Named events

In many cases we have one type of events in one state. If in one state we need to distinguish events then the name of event can be passed to the runner function.

```javascript
const run = machine({
    states: {
        initial: function (event) {
            switch (event) {
                case 'foo': return this.states.final
                case 'bar': break
            }
        },
        final: function (event) {
            switch (event) {
                case 'foo': break 
                case 'bar': return this.states.initial
            }
        }
    }
})

run('foo')
run('bar')
```

To make this approach simplier and robust this module provides a helper. First
the example:

```javascript
const machine = require('u-machine')
const events = require('u-machine/events')

const run = machine({
    states: {
        initial: function (event) {
        console.log(event)
        }
    }
})

events(run, ['foo', 'bar'])

run.foo() // 'foo'
run.bar() // 'bar'
```

Syntax:
```javascript
let object = events(function *runner*, *events*[, *object*])
```
*runner* - The function which will be called when one of event function is
called.

*events* - Array of events' names. This names are used to created named
functions, and will be passed as the first argument to the *runner* function.

*object* - Optional object to which the named function will be attached as
methods. If omitted, the methods will be attached to the *runner* function.
